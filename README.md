[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

This repository contains the code and documentation for my graduate capstone project focused on predicting the outcome of NBA games using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes a comprehensive NBA dataset obtained from Kaggle and employs various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, linear SVC, random forest, and neural networks implemented with the PyTorch library.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing on the NBA dataset to ensure data integrity.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset and identify patterns and trends.
- Develop and train machine learning models to predict the outcome of NBA games.
- Utilize logistic regression, linear SVC, random forest, and neural networks for prediction.
- Apply feature engineering techniques to enhance the predictive capabilities of the models.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics and generate insightful visualizations.
- Document the entire project process and findings in a comprehensive report.

## Dataset

The NBA dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains detailed game statistics and team data information. The dataset has undergone rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accuracy and consistency.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Directory containing the NBA dataset and any additional data files used.
- `notebooks/`: Colab notebooks documenting the data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and model implementation steps.
- `models/`: Saved machine learning models for predicting NBA game outcomes.
- `reports/`: Final project report summarizing the methodology, findings, and visualizations.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions for reproducing the results.
- `LICENSE`: License information for the project.

## Results

After applying machine learning techniques and feature engineering, the logistic regression model achieved an accuracy score of ~62% for predicting the outcome of NBA games. Detailed results, evaluation metrics, and visualizations are in the project report.
